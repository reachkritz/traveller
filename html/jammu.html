The long coastline of Kerala is inextricably entwined with the culture, life and traditions of the state. Memories of early seafarers 

and traders have faded, but boats of various types and styles have survived. Kerala's beaches, or Kovalam to be more specific, were 

rediscovered by back-packers and tan-seekers in the sixties
Kerala , The Green Paradise! The lush greenery greets you everywhere. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are in city, suburban  or a rural 

village, the green flora beckons you.
The color green is the color of nature, fertility and of life.  It is the color of balance. It symbolizes harmony, well being and 

growth.<br> It is said to be the color that relaxes and rejuvenates a person.
Originated over 500 years ago, Kathakali is a spectacular classical dance form of Kerala. It is a combination of drama, dance, music 

and ritual. Kathakali is one of the oldest theatre forms in the world. The word 'Katha' in Malayalam means Story and 'kali' means 

Play. Thus Kathakali literally means 'Story-Play'.<br>
Kerala is known as the "Land of Spices" because it traded spices with Europe 
 Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and red meat with rice a 

typical accompaniment. Chillies, curry leaves, mustard seeds, tamarind and asafoetida are all frequently used."
The Oberoi Motor Vessel Vrinda, is docked at a private jetty on Vembanad Lake, at Pathiramanal, Kayyipuram, near Allepey. <br>The
